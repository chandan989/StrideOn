## üåü What is StrideOn?

StrideOn is a *decentralized, move-to-earn game* where your physical movement becomes strategic gameplay. Built on *Signify Mainnet* with *Very Network* integration and powered by *VeryChat* social features, it transforms your city into a competitive arena using cutting-edge H3 hexagonal spatial indexing.

### üéØ Core Concept
- *Trail & Claim*: Create live trails as you move, mapped to H3 hex cells for precision
- *Loop Closure*: Return to your existing territory to claim the enclosed hexagonal area
- *Tactical Risk*: Your active trail is vulnerable‚Äîrivals can cut it by crossing your path
- *Territory Control*: Expand, defend, and outmaneuver nearby runners in real-time
- *Earn VERY*: Get rewarded with VERY tokens based on area claimed and strategic play

### Speed-First Design Philosophy
- *Off-chain Game Loop*: Sub-150ms response time for real-time gameplay
- *On-chain Settlement*: Trustless verification and reward distribution via Merkle proofs
- *Redis-First Architecture*: Hot game state in memory, Postgres for finalized results only
- *Regional Sharding*: Spatial optimization using H3 grid clustering for scalability
- *Edge Optimization*: CDN deployment for global low-latency access

---

## üéÆ Core Features & Gameplay

### üó∫ Advanced H3 Spatial System

*H3 Hexagonal Grid Technology:*
- *Resolution Level*: City-scale granularity (H3 resolution 9-10)
- *Equal-area Cells*: Consistent territory measurement across all locations
- *Neighbor Consistency*: Efficient pathfinding and collision detection
- *Spatial Optimization*: Fast proximity queries and regional sharding

```python
# H3 Grid Implementation Example
def snap_gps_to_h3(lat: float, lng: float, resolution: int = 9) -> str:
    """Convert GPS coordinates to H3 hex cell"""
    h3_index = h3.latlng_to_cell(lat, lng, resolution)
    return h3_index

def detect_loop_closure(trail: List[str], owned_territory: Set[str]) -> bool:
    """Check if trail intersects owned territory for loop closure"""
    return any(cell in owned_territory for cell in trail)
```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ Real-Time Territory Control

*Trail Creation & Management:*
- *Live GPS Tracking*: Continuous location updates with Kalman filtering
- *Trail Snapping*: GPS coordinates mapped to H3 hexagonal cells
- *Path Optimization*: Duplicate cell removal and efficient trail storage
- *Loop Detection*: Advanced polygon detection when returning to owned territory
- *Area Calculation*: Precise territory measurement using flood-fill algorithms

*Cut Mechanics & Interception:*
```python
def check_trail_intersection(trail_a: List[H3Cell], trail_b: List[H3Cell]) -> bool:
    """Real-time collision detection between player trails"""
    for segment_a in get_segments(trail_a):
        for segment_b in get_segments(trail_b):
            if segments_intersect(segment_a, segment_b):
                return True
    return False
```

### ‚ö° Strategic Power-ups System

| Power-up | Effect | Duration | Cost | Strategic Use |
|----------|--------|----------|------|---------------|
| üõ° *Shield* | Trail immunity from cuts | 60 seconds | 50 VERY | Protect risky expansions |
| üëª *Ghost Mode* | Invisible to other players | 45 seconds | 75 VERY | Stealth territory grabs |
| üöÄ *Speed Boost* | 2x claim rate multiplier | 90 seconds | 100 VERY | Maximize area capture |
| ‚ùÑ *Freeze* | Stop nearby players for 30s | 30 seconds | 150 VERY | Defensive strategy |
| üî• *Burn* | Destroy rival territory | Instant | 200 VERY | Aggressive takeover |

### üèÜ Competitive Elements
- *Daily Leaderboards*: City-wide rankings with real-time updates
- *Multiple Categories*: Area Claimed, Distance Traveled, Cuts Made
- *Seasonal Tournaments*: Special rewards and global competitions
- *Guild-based Team Competitions*: Coordinate with VeryChat integration

### üí∞ Advanced Token Economics

*VERY Token Utility:*
- *Base Rewards*: 1 VERY per 100 square meters claimed
- *Multipliers*: Up to 5x for consecutive daily play
- *Staking Benefits*: Lock tokens for 2x earning rate
- *Power-up Costs*: Strategic spending for competitive advantage
- *Guild Treasuries*: Shared resources for team strategies

*Economic Balancing:*
- Daily reward caps to prevent inflation
- Dynamic pricing based on city activity levels
- Seasonal token burns for deflation
- Cross-city arbitrage opportunities

### Backend Architecture (Python FastAPI)

*High-Performance Server Design:*
```python
# Real-time Game Server
class GameServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = Redis(host=REDIS_HOST, port=REDIS_PORT, db=0)
        self.supabase = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
        self.h3_engine = H3Engine()
        self.websocket_manager = WebSocketManager()
    
    async def handle_gps_update(self, user_id: str, gps_point: GPSPoint):
        """Process incoming GPS data with sub-150ms latency"""
        # Snap to H3 grid
        h3_cell = self.h3_engine.latlng_to_cell(
            gps_point.lat, gps_point.lng, resolution=9
        )
        
        # Update active trail in Redis
        trail_key = f"trail:{user_id}:active"
        await self.redis.lpush(trail_key, h3_cell)
        await self.redis.expire(trail_key, 1800)  # 30 min TTL
        
        # Check for collisions with other players
        nearby_players = await self.get_nearby_players(h3_cell, radius=5)
        for player in nearby_players:
            if await self.check_trail_intersection(user_id, player.id):
                await self.process_cut_event(user_id, player.id)
        
        # Broadcast to regional channel
        await self.websocket_manager.broadcast_to_region(
            h3_cell, {"type": "position_update", "user": user_id, "cell": h3_cell}
        )
```

*Redis Data Structures:*
```python
# Game State Storage Patterns
REDIS_PATTERNS = {
    # Active game state (hot data)
    "trail:{user_id}:active": "LIST of H3 cells",
    "presence:{user_id}": "HASH {lat, lng, h3_index, timestamp}",
    "session:{session_id}:state": "HASH {user_id, start_time, status}",
    
    # Spatial indexing
    "geo:presence:city:{city}": "GEOSPATIAL index of active players",
    "cells:claimed:{city}": "SET of claimed H3 cells",
    
    # Event streams
    "events:cuts:{city}": "STREAM of cut events with MAXLEN 1000",
    "events:claims:{city}": "STREAM of territory claims with MAXLEN 1000",
    
    # Regional pub/sub
    "channel:region:{h3_parent}": "PUB/SUB for regional updates"
}
```
