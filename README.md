## üéØ The Opportunity: Making Fitness Fun & Web3 Accessible

The world is full of fitness apps that become boring after a week and complex Web3 games that are disconnected from our real lives. **StrideOn** seizes this opportunity by fusing the two. We've created a "move-to-earn" game that is genuinely fun, deeply social, and serves as a seamless on-ramp to the Web3 world.

## üí° Our Solution: A Real-World GPS Strategy Game

StrideOn is a game of risk, strategy, and speed, played on the streets of your own city using cutting-edge H3 hexagonal spatial indexing for precision territory control.

### Core Gameplay Loop

**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Create Your Trail:** Players create glowing GPS paths called "Trails" on a live map by walking or running. Every step is mapped to H3 hex cells, creating a precise digital representation of your real-world movement.

**‚öîÔ∏è Strategic Territory Battles:** The game becomes thrilling through conflict. You can see active trails of rival players in your area. If you physically cross their path, you **"cut"** their trail and steal all their unclaimed progress. Alternatively, create strategic loops by returning to your existing territory to claim the enclosed hexagonal area.

**üè¶ Bank Your Victory:** To secure your points, you must strategically reach real-world landmarks that serve as "banking checkpoints." Banking converts your claimed territory into permanent VERY tokens stored securely on the blockchain, making them safe from future attacks.

This creates a thrilling battle for territory where every street corner holds potential rivals and every route decision impacts your earnings.
