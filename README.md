# GeoConquer
GeoConquer is a decentralized running game where real-world joggers conquer and defend territories by moving through them, all powered by Web3. Using blockchain and GPS, every run you make can help you claim new zones, see other players nearby, and grow your digital domain-without relying on a central authority.
